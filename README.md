## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Crow-Studio/zadaci.git
cd zadaci
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and copy the following content:

```env
NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3001"
NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME="Zadaci"
NITRO_PORT=3001

NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD="your-secure-session-password"
ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-encryption-key"

# Google OAuth
NUXT_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
NUXT_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
NUXT_OAUTH_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL="http://localhost:3001/api/auth/signin/google"

# Database
DATABASE_URL="your-postgres-url"

# Email (Resend)
NUXT_RESEND_API_KEY="your-resend-api-key"

# Cloudinary
NUXT_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name"
NUXT_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_API_KEY="your-cloud-api-key"
NUXT_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_API_SECRET="your-cloud-api-secret"
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations

```bash
pnpm run db:migrate
```

### 5. Enable Supabase Realtime

For cross-tab live sync, tables must be added to the `supabase_realtime` publication:

```bash
pnpm run db:realtime
```

**Always verify** after running — don't trust the Supabase dashboard toggle:

```sql
select schemaname, tablename
from pg_publication_tables
where pubname = 'supabase_realtime'
order by tablename;
```

> If a table you expect isn't in the output, the `alter publication` didn't take. Re-run `pnpm run db:realtime` and verify again. The tracked source of truth is `server/database/enable-realtime.sql` — update that file when adding new Tier 1 tables.

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to open Zadaci.
